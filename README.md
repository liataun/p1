## Outside resources
Had an issue where nano glitched. Used this [ask ubuntu stopped jobs error](https://askubuntu.com/questions/431606/what-should-i-do-when-i-get-there-are-stopped-jobs-error) and this [stack exchange exit or cancel bash command](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/45646/how-do-i-exit-or-cancel-a-bad-bash-command).

I love syntax reminders, so used the [php manual](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phpmode.php) to make sure I didn't slip into C or Java syntax, [w3 css reference](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) for color hex values, and [w3 html reference](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) for em dash.

Early [w3 validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) item led me to reading into the language support in html on [w3 International authoring](https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/authoring-html#textprocessing).

## Notes for instructor
I made use of Sublime Text's HTML tag completion while typing up my code files. It makes quickly adding elements and properties easier, but seems like something I should note, since we are focusing on basics for this project.

Initially was thinking I would try using a grid layout to make it nicely responsive, but could not decide on how I wanted to arrange my small handful of elements, so decided to practice that later.

I know the final design of the website is a tad ugly. I left it that way to remind me to read up on Design Principles. I know this is a server side course, but I want to encourage myself to think about form as well as function. Best way to do that is to make something I have an almost irresistible urge to fix!
