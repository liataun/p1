## Outside resources
Had an issue where nano glitched. Used this [ask ubuntu stopped jobs error](https://askubuntu.com/questions/431606/what-should-i-do-when-i-get-there-are-stopped-jobs-error) and this [stack exchange exit or cancel bash command](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/45646/how-do-i-exit-or-cancel-a-bad-bash-command).

I always need syntax reminders so checked around the [php manual](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phpmode.php) and the
w3 [css reference](https://www.w3schools.com/css/).

Early w3 validator item lead me to reading into some of the language support in html on [w3 International authoring](https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/authoring-html#textprocessing).

## Notes for instructor
I made use of Sublime Text's HTML tag completion while typing up my code files. It makes quickly adding elements and properties easier, but seems like something I should note, since we are focusing on basics for this project.
